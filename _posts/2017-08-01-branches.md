# Branching Approach

## What is a branch and why do we need them
Multi Version File Systems (MVFS) have been with us for a long time.  Usually associated with version controls systems, they allow us to manage multiple versions of file system components (files, directories, etc) at the same time.  I see three key things (at a minimum) that they provide:

1. __Head__: the most recent part of the mainline (master) version of the file system
1. __Branches__: a way to change code away from the mainline
1. __Labels__: a mechanism to refer to a version of the code with a friendly name

The ability to develop code away from the mainline is a key feature for collaborative teams to work alongside each other.  If you think of a MVFS as graph (specifically a Directed Acyclic Graph - DAG) with nodes and edges, where each branch of the graph is a named flow of change you can build up a mental picure of a Version Control System (VCS).

## Artefact promotion over branch promotion

## Standards
 - All code changes happen on a feature branch separated from the main (master) branch and is tested and reviewed before merge
 - Branches are short lived as they break Continuous Integration principles
 - Applications are versioned based on their date and work partition.  Year/sprint/patch.  Include brahch name if not from master.
 - Master should be releasable at all times
 - Plan to segregate functionality instead of feature branching, use tests to verify functionality
 - Use a single standard release approach/mechanism
 - anything on a branch should be nmerged back to mainline ... no implicit forking

Merge to master rules
