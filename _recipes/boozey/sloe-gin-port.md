My yearly cycle for this to make the sloe gin end of September and get it stewing ready to decant into bottles on boxing day. I then make the slow port from the residue ready for easter.

---
## Ingredients
- Sloe gin
    - 500g or sloes or damsons
    - 250g caster sugar
    - 1ltr Gin or Vodka
- Slow Port
    - All the fruit residue from the making of sloe gin
    - 100g caster sugar
    - 1ltr of red wine
    - 300ml French brandy

## Method
- Pick sloes (or damsons) around the end of September from blackthorn bushes (find south facing hedges for best crop). If you leave too late the birds and neighbours will get them all.
- Freeze the fruit for at least 24 hours so the skins split. I have bags of 500g in the freezer for a few years so you can leave the process to later in the year.
- In a large Kilner jar add the frozen fruit, sugar and spirit. Put this in a cool dark place in the house and be patient.
- Once every couple of weeks I give it a good shake to get it all infusing.
- After three months you are ready to decant the gin.
- Make sure you clean the bottles properly, use the sterilizing tablets people use for baby bottles.
- To decant the gin, I pour the gin through a muslin (still have a few left from the babies) first, then I filter with a coffee filter in a funnel to get all the really small stuff out. If you get this bit right it should last for years. I decant to the top of the bottle to minimise the air at the top of the bottle.
- Then put all the fruit back into the Kilner jar, add in sugar, red wine initially and put in a cool dark place for a month.
- After a month open it all up and add the brandy.
- After a total of 3-4 months (depending when easter lands) decant as you did for the gin.

## Also
- Don't use cheap wine/gin/vodka & use Napoleonic brandy
- I tend to use a strong flavoured red like a Rioja or a Malbec for the port
- Make sure you sterilise the bottles you decant into (baby sterile tablets)
- Some people put cinnamon sticks or star anise in … I don't … heathens!
- Use more brandy than the online recipes show … my granddad accused me of scrimping on the brandy many years ago (on his deathbed, he supped the above and said I got it "about right" … I've taken that as a win).
- If you can do it in batches it makes lots of sense (e.g. get 5-6 Kilner jars going)
- Use gin bottles with a cork in as these hold better and look good at dinner parties
- Once done, store them in a cool place (e.g. in the cellar)
- Best drunk neat, but if you mix with champagne or prosecco people tend to stumble home with a smile on their face.
