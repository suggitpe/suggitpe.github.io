## The basics
Something for the kids!!! This pizza dough recipe is super simple to make, especially if you have a food mixer. This recipe is best made the day before you want to use it.

This version of the dough is done trying to make as little mess as possible ... I'm lazy!

> If you find the dough does not rise, this is most likely caused by dead yeast.  Replace the yeast and start again.

## Ingredients
* 100g Semolina
* 500g Strong Bread Flour
* 350ml warm water
* 1 1/2 tablespoons dried active yeast
* 1 tablespoon sugar (prefer brown)
* Chilli flakes
* Salt
* Pepper
* A sprig of rosemary chopped up finely
* A few decent glugs of Virgin Olive Oil

## Utensils
* Food mixer with a dough hook is best
    * Or manually kneed the dough and bust those 'bingo wings'

* Pizza Stone or Tray for the oven
    * I use the non stick pizza trays from Lakeland

## How to make the dough
1. Get a big mixing bowl and drop in the flour and semolina
1. Add salt and pepper (plus chilli flakes if you like it spicy)
1. Add the rosemary and mix it all up
1. Fill up a mixing jug with the warm water and mix in the sugar
1. Mix the yeast with the water and stir in.
1. Leave it all for 15 minutes to let the yeast activate
1. Pour the Olive Oil into the jug with the yeast and give it a good stir
1. Make a dip in the flour mix and pour in the yeast/water mix
1. Get a fork and mix it all up ... this is the messy bit
1. Kneed the dough in either the food mixer or manually
1. Once the dough is silky put it in a freezer bag and pop it in the fridge knocking it back once in a while
1. Keep it in the freezer bag as its a sticky dough

## Making the pizza base
* On a work surface (I have a big wooden chopping board) spread a load of semolina and flour.
* You will need quite a bit to stop it sticking.  
* Flatten a ball of dough and then use a rolling pin to thin the ball into a pizza base shape.
* I have yet to achieve the dizzying heights of spinning the dough in the air.

## Toppings
Now add on the pasatta and toppings etc.  Try the following:

 - Dates and Bacon: fast fry the bacon and add the diced dates later
 - Mushroom, chorizo and chilli
 - Mix Mozzarella and Cheddar
 - Sprinkle mixed herbs over the top before you bake
