## Method

- Roast cashew nuts at 200c for 10 mins … need them crunchy
- Prepare the chicken into dices, and marinade for at least a hour with soy sauce (light and dark). I put into freezer bag and leave overnight in fridge.
- Make the sauce in a cup: soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, Shaoxing Wine, Fish Sauce, Hoisin.
- Medium heat: Fry off the marinaded chicken with a good dose of paprika and flour in a pan. Add sesame seeds too. Put to one side when it's cooked through.
- Low heat: cook off the garlic, ginger and the white bottoms of the spring onions. Give this a few mins, then add in the chilli(s).
- High heat: Give a few minutes and add the peppers, mushrooms, edamame, broccoli and onions (roughly chopped). Add a good dose of sesame seeds. Let the onions soften, then re-add the chicken.
- Add in the sauce and let it reduce until it starts to be sticky.
- In final minute: add the chopped top of spring onions, roasted cashew nuts.
- Serve with jasmine rice and a good dose of coriander (option to add sliced chili on the top for those that like a bit more heat)
