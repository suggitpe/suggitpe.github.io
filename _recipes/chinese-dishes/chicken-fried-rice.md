## Ingredients

- Thumb sized piece of Ginger (fresh)
- 1-2 chillies (optional)
- Cup full of frozen Peas

## Method
- Pop a bowl into a warming draw or really low oven as you will put parts to the side in the cook.
- Slice chicken in to long thin strips and marinade chicken in a mix of soy sauce, onion granules, sesame oil. I tend to put into a freezer bag and leave in the fridge
- Chop up the spring onions separating out the green tops from the white bottoms.
- Into the frying pan, add garlic sliced, ginger sliced, spring onion bottoms and (optional) chili sliced and cook for about 1 minute, then add the chicken until golden, then put aside in the warm bowl
- Fry up the peas, carrots, tender-stem stems for about 2-3 minutes, then add the tender-stem fleurettes and mushrooms. Once they have softened (5-8 mins) put them into the bowl with the chicken.
- Wisk up the eggs and add to the pan and scramble them, once cooked add the cold microwave rive to the pan and keep it moving. Add some soy sauce to the rice and keep it moving, add Chinese five spice to the rice (add to taste) and keep it moving.
- Once rice is warmed up, add in all the cooked chicken and veg and move it all.
- Season with pepper and sesame seeds.
- At the last minute throw in the spring onion tops and take it off the heat.
- Stir it all well and serve.
- Optionally add black sesame seeds for dressing.
- I tend to add a bit more soy sauce.

Note the classic recipe is three meats and three vegetables, so there is an option to swap the chicken for any leftover meat.
