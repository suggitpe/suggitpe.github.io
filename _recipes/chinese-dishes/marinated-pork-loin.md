title: Chinese Marinaded Pork Loin

Each loin will cover two people generously so factor in that you might need a few loins if this is for a sunday roast.  To make the most of the marinade you need to soak the meat overnight before cooking (preferably two days).  This pork recipe works really well with the [Special Fried Rice](special-fried-rice.html).

## The marinade (Char Sui)
In a decent sized measuring jug add the following.  You want to get a sticky sauce consistency so add more honey/hoisin if its too runny:

  * 1 Tablespoon of Hoisin Sauce
  * 1/2 Tablespoon of honey
  * 2 Tablespoon of dark soy sauce
  * 1/2 Tablespoon of Rice Wine
  * 1 Teaspoon of Sesame Oil
  * 3 Tablespoons of soft brown sugar
  * 2 Cloves of garlic chopped
  * Pepper
  * Pinch of Chinese 5 spice
  * A few drops of Tabasco Sauce

## To prepare the loin
Trim as much of the fat off the meat as you can without being silly.  On the top of the loin you will see the silverskin.  The best way to do this is to push a sharp knife under the silverskin and with the blade aimed up a little bit slice down the length.  You will lose a small amount of meat but, hey, that's life.  Once you have trimmed the meat, score the meat on both sides so the marinade can soak in.  Cut the loin into two pieces so its easier to cook.  Put the whole lot into a freezer bag so you can move the meat and marinade around. If you want to spread the food out, put in two bags and freeze one of them.

## The cook
1. On a roasting tray for 40 minutes at 180c.  
1. If you let the drippings hit the metal of the pan it will turn to charcoal so put put some water underneath the pork, this will make a good sauce on the pork.
1. For the final part of the cook, baste the pork with a honey glaze (honey and hot water in a 2:1 ratio) and grill it.
1. Make sure to rest the meat for 10 minutes before you serve.
