I made this one from seeing a great [you tube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_ZRhqkWHfU) session from [The Dumpling Sisters](https://thedumplingsisters.com/) on the basics of fried rice.  Our local Chinese take-away shut down a while ago and I have been hankering for good Chinese food since then.  This recipe takes a number of shortcuts to make it simpler to make.  It usually serves three people, or two if you have The Hunger!

> Key principle with a fried rice: you need three meats and three vegetables to make it work.

## Ingredients

 * Fresh ginger root (about the size of your thumb), chopped finely
 * 5 cloves of Fresh garlic crushed or chopped finely
 * Two red chilies cut finely
 * Three meats (roughly 100g of each) diced to about the size of your small finger nail
    * Prawns
    * 1 cooked Chicken breast
    * Marinated Pork
 * Three veg (roughly 100g of each) diced to about the size of your small finger nail
    * Mushrooms cut finely (diced)
    * Carrots (pre-boiled for 4 minutes)
    * Garden peas
 * 3 eggs beaten with a small dash of milk
 * Tilda microwave rice (250g)
 * Onion powder
 * Chinese 5 spice
 * Soy Sauce
 * Spring onion greens chopped roughly

## All about the preparation

This recipe needs constant stirring so I have everything prepared in advance of the actual cook (in bowls).  I lump them up into the following:

  * The wok/pan with some oil, ginger, garlic and chili
  * A bowl of all the meat prepared
  * A bowl with all of the vegetables
  * The eggs beaten in a coffee mug
  * The rice in the microwave ready to go
  * The spring onions cut up on a chopping board

End result: when we need it we can use and stir at the same time

## The cook

Start by heating up the pan with the ginger, garlic, chilies in and let the flavours merge into the oil.  Once this is cooked (est 3 mins), add in all the meat.  Because the meat has been pre-cooked, it tends to stick so keep it moving all the time.  We want the meat to soak up all the flavours in the pan.  Once this is cooked (the prawn go super small but thats OK) put them all back in the bowl they came from.

Now add some more oil to the pan and when hot, add the vegetables.  Stir until the mushrooms soften.  Now move all the veg to one size of the pan and tilt the pan.  Add the eggs and scramble them away from the veg.  Once the eggs are cooked mix up with the veg and add the meat back into the pan along with the cooked rice.  Over the top add a liberal amount of onion powder and Chinese 5 spice stirring all the time.  Then add a good amount of soy sauce (I tend to use loads but this is down to taste ... if you are giving to the kids, don't add too much as its too much salt).  Once its all cooked (try it as it cooks), take it off the heat and add the spring onion greens to the mix (its better if they are crunchy).

Serve with a little extra soy sauce and enjoy.
