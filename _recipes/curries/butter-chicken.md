## Method
1. Marinade chicken
    * Slice up the chicken into a bowl 
    * Add yoghurt and spices, mixing as you go along
    * Pop in the fridge for at least a few hours
1. Cook chicken
    * Put the chicken on a roasting tray and grill the chicken until the you can see the chicken slightly burn on the edges … drain the juice halfway through to add to curry later
    * Alternatively you can fry the chicken in the marinade just dont burn in the pan
1. Toast the spices then grind them up
    * Toast mustard seeds, fennel, cumin seeds, coriander seeds, deshelled cardamom seeds, dried chilli (whole)
    * In a mortar or a spice grinder grind them up into a fine powder for later
1. Create the sauce
    * On a low heat add the onions finely for a good 10 mins until they have softened
    * Peal and finely slice the ginger and add to the onions
    * Slice up fresh chilli and add to the pan
    * Finely slice the garlic and add
    * Season with salt and pepper
    * Add three good knobs of butter (don't let it burn)
    * Chop up the stalks of the coriander and leave the leaves until later
    * Add in all the toasted ground spices from earlier and stir well into the mix
    * Let the spices infuse into the pan for a few minutes
    * Once it's all cooked well add tomato passata, or freshly copped tomatoes
    * Once the tomatoey mix has boiled you need to add in the double-cream
    * Turn down the pan now and let it cook
    * Taste and season
    * Add the lemon juice and let it slowly come to heat until bubbling
    * If you want to you can blend it now, but i prefer it slightly rough
    * Add all the grilled chicken into the sauce
    * Add two more knobs of butter into the sauce, but do not let it boil
    * Keep the sauce moving to stop it boiling
    * Add in the lemon zest and coriander leaves

Serve with fresh naan, rice with some of the Dishoom Gunpowder potatoes on the side

## Notes
* For the marinade try adding 1 tsp of the ground up spices from the Dishoom gunpowder potatoes recipe [here](https://www.dishoom.com/journal/recipes/dishoom-gunpowder-potatoes-side-dish-recipe/).  I did an extra large batch of them the last time and kept in a spice jar.
