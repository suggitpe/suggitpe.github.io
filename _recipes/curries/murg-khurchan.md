During my stay at the Oberoi Hotel in Gurgaon, Northern India, I discovered the delightful Murg Khurchan. Initially, I ordered the Chicken Tikka, but the waiter recommended trying the Murg Khurchan, and it turned out to be the best curry I've ever tasted. This recipe is inspired by Marut Sikka's version, which seems to be the most authentic.

Marut Sikka has been acclaimed by India's leading food critics as the only individual in this century to have done the most to revive and nurture the traditions of North Indian cooking.
