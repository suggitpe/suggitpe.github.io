## Method
- Marinade the chicken with three tablespoons of yoghurt (plus Garam Masala, salt a loads of black pepper) at least for 2 hours … make sure its well mixed and has time to soak into the chicken
- Roast the Mustard Seeds in a dry pan until toasted … then put aside to cool off
- Good knob of butter in a pan and fry off onions and red pepper
- I'll let that go for 15 mins or so on a low heat (Pete did on crazy low heat for 20-25 mins)
- Chuck in the chilli, garlic,  tomato puree, garam masala, turmeric and paprika.  Obviously volumes to taste but I generally go with double the garam masala to the others.
- Let it form into a paste then add in fresh tomatoes and let it cook down
- Brown off the chicken in a separate frying pan at a really high heat to brown off the yoghurt … you cant do this in the main pan as the heat is too low
- Cook out for a while then add chopped chicken thigh, brown it off
- Add a little water to loosen it all, let it reduce … then keep repeating this until is really soft
- Add a little lemon into the main mix
- Throw in a good two or three tablespoons of ground almonds and a couple of pinches of sugar.
- When it's cooked so the water has evaporated I add a splash of single cream just to loosen it, not make it wet. Or add in a load of yoghurt and make it into a full on curry.
- Salt and pepper to taste.
- Then I mix natural yogurt with some finely chopped cucumber and a tiny splash of lemon juice.
- Spread some on a big naan, throw a few dollops of mango chutney on top, curry on top of that, wrap and eat
- It gets messy!
- I sometimes do spice cauliflower on the side
