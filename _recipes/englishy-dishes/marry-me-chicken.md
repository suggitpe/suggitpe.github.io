- Add in the parmesan and basil leaves, mix for 30 seconds then re-add the chicken to the pan and stir well (include any chicken juices).
- Cook it for another minute or two until it's all hot.

Serve on mashed potato, rice or pasta with chopped up basil on top.

Note: take care how much salt you add, if you add bacon and salt too early it can be too much.
