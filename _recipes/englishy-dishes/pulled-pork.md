## Method
- Prepare meat
    - Grind peppercorns and fennel.
    - Mix all the spices and herbs together (not bay).
    - Rub mix into the pork shoulder and leave in fridge overnight (min 2 hours)
- Sear the meat in a hot casserole dish making sure it's well browned (flavour)
- Add in honey, chilli, bay, wine, vinegar, tomatoes (chopped), garlic and bring to the boil
- Cook in the oven for 190°C for 1 hour, then … reduce heat to 160°C for 2 ½ to 3 hours.
- In the pan pull the pork apart … look out for any big lumps of fat and remove
- Pop it back in the oven once pulled to then soak up the juices (15 mins usually about right)
    - Personally I liked the pork a little bit burned …
- Serve with fresh coleslaw … in a bun perhaps.

## Coleslaw
- ½ red or white cabbage
- ½ red onion grated
- 1 carrot grated
- 3 tbsp mayo
- 1tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tsp white wine vinegar
- 1 tbsp wholegrain mustard
- Pinch sugar
- Salt and pepper

Use a potato peeler to shred the cabbage and carrot. Separately mix the mayo and flavour separately, then mix with the cabbage.

## Leftovers
If you have done it right you will find a lot of leftovers, if you are not up for cold meat sandwiches you might want to consider a pasta bake. Finely chop an onion, a stick of celery and a carrot or two and cook up with a red pepper and some mushrooms. Add with 2 fresh tomatoes (chopped) and mix in the pulled pork. Season well (add herbs). Add cooked pasta and cover with mozzarella cheese and then whang it in the oven for 30 mins at 200°C.
