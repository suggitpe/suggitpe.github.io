Beef and ale stew is a great British classic; encasing the rich stew in a crisp golden pastry crust makes a corker of a pie. Hot water crust pastry isn't as tricky as you might think to make and you can prepare the slow-cooked steak filling ahead to make things easier.

## Method
- Preheat the oven to 170C/160C fan.
- Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a non-stick casserole pan over a high heat. Add half the beef to the pan and brown well on all sides, turning as necessary. Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a plate. Add the remaining oil to the pan and brown the remaining beef; set aside on the plate.
- Toss the pancetta into the same casserole pan and cook for 3 -4 minutes or until browned and crispy. Add the onions and carrots and cook for another 3 -4 minutes, then add the tomato purée and stir over the heat for 1 minute. Sprinkle in the flour, stir well and cook for 2 minutes. Now stir in the ale and bring to a simmer. Add the beef stock and herbs and bring back to a simmer. Return the browned beef to the pan and simmer gently for 5 minutes. Season well then place a cartouche (a round of baking paper) on the surface of the stew. Put the lid on and cook in the oven for 2 hours and 30 minutes.
- Remove the pan from the oven, stir and check that the meat is tender. Leave to cool slightly and then place in the fridge to cool completely.
- Meanwhile, make the hot water crust pastry. Put the flour, salt and mustard powder into a stand mixer, fitted with the paddle beater attachment. Make a well in the centre of the flour, add the eggs and beat until well incorporated.
- In a small saucepan over a medium heat, heat the butter, lard and 200ml water until the fats are completely melted. With the mixer on a low speed, gradually pour in the hot liquid until a dough is formed; you might not need all of the liquid. Lift the dough from the bowl and split it into two-thirds and one-third portions.
- On a lightly floured surface, roll out the larger portion of dough to a 36cm square. Cut into 4 equal squares and place one in each of four 10cm mini springform cake tins. Gently push the pastry onto the base and sides to line each tin, leaving the excess overhanging the rim. Brush the edges of the pastry with beaten egg yolk. Fill the pastry-lined tins with the cooled meat filling.
- Roll out the remaining piece of pastry to a 23cm square and cut into 4 equal size squares. Place these on top of the pies and cut away the excess pastry; save the trimmings. Crimp and seal the edges, pressing with your fingertips. Brush the pastry lids evenly with egg glaze and cut a small hole in the middle, to allow the steam to escape during baking. Roll out the pastry trimmings and cut out some decorative leaves. Arrange these on top of the pies and brush them with egg glaze.
- Dust with a mix of fennel, pepper and salt to the top
- Place the pies in the fridge to rest the pastry for 30 minutes.
- Preheat the oven to 200C/180C fan and place a large baking tray in the oven for 15 minutes to heat up. Stand the pies on the hot baking tray and bake for 40 -50 minutes or until the pastry is golden and crisp. Take the tray from the oven and carefully remove the pies from the tins. Brush the outside of each pie with egg glaze and place back in the oven for 15 minutes or until the pies are a deep golden brown.
- Serve hot, with vegetables of your choice. Make sure the veg is not salty as the pie is a little bit salty.
