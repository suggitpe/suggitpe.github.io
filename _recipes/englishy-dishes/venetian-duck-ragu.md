## Ingredients
- 2 Duck Legs

- White wine - ???
- 2 tins chopped tomatoes
- Sugar
- Cinnamon powder
- Thyme
- Chicken stock cube

## Method
- Gently fry off in a deep casserole dish with a  tiny bit of oil (just enough so it doesn't catch. Fry both sides for 2 - 3 mins to release fat and put to one side
- cook off finely diced onion, carrot and celery until soft in the same pan with the fat from the duck
- Chuck in some garlic and then add ~ 100  ml wine per person and half a tin of chopped tomatoes per person
- Cook down for a few min then add ~ a tablespoon per person of sugar and cinnamon powder (yep be liberal) and some thyme
- Add a chicken stock cube / pot and put the duck back in. Then top up with water until the duck is well covered
- At this point I usually put in in the oven at 150 for a good 2 - 3 hours (keep an eye on it so it doesn't reduce too much and top up with water if needed).
- You can leave on a low heat on the hob for an hour instead but the duck isn't as soft that way
- Remove from the oven and remove the duck legs - take skin away and shred the meat.
- Let the  sauce sit for a bit and the fat will float to the surface, at which point I tend to skim off the excess
- Then cook on the hob until it's reduced to your preferred consistency (if you like it thick you can help by adding a tablespoon for flour when frying off the veg)
- Add the shredded duck and heat through + salt & pepper to taste
- mix in with cooked pasta (I recommend rigatoni)
- Then serve with lashings of parmesan on top - it's needed to offset the sweetness so be liberal
