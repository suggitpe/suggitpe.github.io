## Summary
Peter offers over 15 years of experience within Capital Markets software development.  Fusing a strong business domain knowledge and excellent technical aptitude, he brings a unique set of skills to the development teams he works with.  Peter operates across a number of disciplines: Architecture; Agile coaching; Software Development coaching; leading teams/departments; building outsourced teams.  In his career, he has actively sought out new challenges to deepen and broaden his skills and experience.

Peter is a passionate technologist who is experienced in many languages, enterprise techniques/frameworks and approaches.  He makes a point of writing code every day, both inside teams and, externally, working on pet projects and evaluation of new technologies/languages.  As a hands-on figurehead technologist in UBS, he dedicates a large proportion of his time to training/coaching teams and individuals to deliver software in the most effective manner.  Peter's current focus is based around agile test driven development techniques, approaches and designs at an enterprise scale and how to curate a development function around them.

While Peter dedicates a significant proportion of his time working across the development teams, he is equally effective with stakeholders and senior management and has regular interactions and input into the wider programme governance and structure.  Peter's current role as Head of Development allows him to demonstrate his effectiveness in the software delivery lifecycle; from requirements capture through to delivery.
