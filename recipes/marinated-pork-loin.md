## The basics
Each loin will cover two people generously so factor in that you might need a few loins if this is for a sunday roast.  To make the most of the marinade you need to soak the meat overnight before cooking (preferably two days).

## The marinade
In a decent sized measuring jug add the following in equal quantities:

1. Soy Sauce
1. Lemon Juice
1. Olive Oil

Then add:

1. Tabasco Sauce
1. Black Pepper
1. Chilli Flakes
1. A good dollup of honey
1. English mustard powder (1/4 teaspoon)

## To prepare the loin
Trim as much of the fat off the meat as you can without being silly.  On the top of the loin you will see the silverskin.  The best way to do this is to push a sharp knife under the silverskin and with the blade aimed up a little bit slice down the length.  You will lose a small amount of meat but, hey, that's life.  Once you have trimmed the meat, score the meat on both sides so the marinade can soak in.  Put the meat into the marinade and squish it in so its all covered.  Now cover up the jug/bowl and pop in the fridge overnight.

## The cook
Super simple: on a roasting tray for 20 minutes at 200c.  Make sure to rest the meat for 10 minutes before you carve.  I carve at an angle to make the thin medallions larger.
