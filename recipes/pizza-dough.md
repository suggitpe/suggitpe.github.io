## The basics
Something for the kids!!! This pizza dough recipe is super simple to make, especially if you have a food mixer. This recipe is best made the day before you want to use it.

This version of the dough is done trying to make as little mess as possible ... I'm lazy!

## Ingredients
* 100g Semolina
* 500g Strong Bread Flour
* 350ml warm water
* 1 1/2 tablespoons dried active yeast
* 1 tablespoon sugar (prefer brown)
* Salt
* Pepper
* Rosemary chopped up finely
* A few decent glugs of Virgin Olive Oil

## Utensils
* Food mixer with a dough hook is best
    * Or manually kneed the dough and bust those 'bingo wings'
