## The basics
This recipe is my family's favorite of all the recipes that I make.  I make a huge batch every month or so and the freeze it is sharable portions.  On busy days we defrost and it makes dinner a simple affair.

## Ingredients
 - 2Kg of the leanest minced beef you can find (5%)
 - 2 big [onions diced finely](tips.html#dice_onion)

## The cook
1. I tend to prepare the onions
1. Start by cooking the mince in a deep frying pan.  We want to get the meat brown and the fat cooked off.  Drain the fat away so you are left with the lean cooked meat.  Put to one side as you will need it later.
