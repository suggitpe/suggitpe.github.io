## The basics

I made this one from seeing a great youtube session on the basics of fried rice.  Our local chinese takeaway shut down a while ago and I have been hankering for chinese food since then.  This recipe takes a number of shortcuts to make it simpler to make.  It usually serves three people, or two if you have The Hunger!

Key principle with a fried rice: you need three meats and three vegatables to make it work.
