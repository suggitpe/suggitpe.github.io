## The basics

I made this one from seeing a great youtube session on the basics of fried rice.  Our local chinese takeaway shut down a while ago and I have been hankering for chinese food since then.  This recipe takes a number of shortcuts to make it simpler to make.  It usually serves three people, or two if you have The Hunger!

Key principle with a fried rice: you need three meats and three vegatables to make it work.

## Ingredients

 * Fresh ginger root (about the size of your thumb), chopped finely
 * 5 cloves of Fresh garlic crushed or chopped finely
 * Two red chilies cut finely
 * Three meats (roughly 100g of each) diced to about the size of your small finger nail
    * Prawns
    * 1 cooked Chicken breast
    * Marinated Pork
 * Three veg (roughly 100g of each)
    * Mushrooms
    * Carrots (pre-boiled for 4 mins)
    * Garden peas
 * Tilda microwave rice (250g)
 * Onion powder
 * Chinese 5 spice
 * Soy Sauce
 * Spring onion greens chopped roughly

## All about the preparation

This recipe needs constant stirring so I have everything prepared in advance of the actual cook (in bowls).  I lump them up into the following:

  * The wok/pan with some oil, ginger, garlic and chili
  * A bowl of all the meat prepared
  * A bowl with all of the vegatables
  * The eggs beaten in a coffee mug
  * The rice in the microwave ready to go
  * The pring onions cut up on a chopping board

End result: when I need it I can use and stir at the same time
