## <a name="dice_onion"></a>Dicing an onion
There is a great way to finely dice an onion that I learned in a professional kitchen.  It goes like this:

1. Cut the onion in half starting at the root (brush away the grit before you start)
1. Peal the onion skin back to the fresh layer
1. For each side of the onion
  - slice down the onion from the root to the head but leave it all attached
  - then slice through the onion (knife flat)
  - then slice the onion against the grain leaving lots of little dices of onion
